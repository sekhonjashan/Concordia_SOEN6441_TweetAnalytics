<b>Details of Twitter Oauth login implementation:</b>
 Â <p>

- First created an application on twitter which is needed to authorise user using twitter to our implemented web app. You can create twitter app at:
  href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new"
- When your twitter app is created you can see your created app in My apps: href="https://apps.twitter.com/"
- Then entering into your twitter application, you can see "keys and access token" link, where lies your "CONSUMER KEY" and "CONSUMER   SECRET".
- Then, I have created a "Twitter" class under Controllers package : app/controllers/Twitter.java
- You have to enter your Twitter application's consumer key and secret into Twitter controller class.
- Added twitter routes in my routes file: conf/routes
- Added dependency "ws" in buid.sbt file: /build.sbt
